## Bio

Name: Mark or **MORK** <br> <br>
I am a web developer specializes in front-end web development (Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, Bootstrap, Jquery, etc.). I am also a mechanical keyboard enthusiast and a "speed" typist (emphasis on the quotes). I enjoy collecting keyboards and modding the hell out of them.
